Rebol is a highly versatile, multiplatform scripting language for
Lightweight Distributed Computing created by Carl Sassenrath.
Originally, REBOL was an acronym Relative Expression-Based Object
Language.

It was designed with the aim of being a human-centric, network-based
messaging language. It is a first class functional scripting language
with automatic memory management, higher order functions, exception
handling, and dialecting. It includes many built-in functions that
allow you to work with math, text, files, networking, graphics and
multimedia.
